// Critical Performance Path: Dashboard Initial Load

  // Current bottlenecks identified:
  bottlenecks: [
    "No data prefetching on page load",
    "Sequential API calls instead of parallel",
    "No skeleton loading states",
    "Large bundle size without code splitting"
  ],
  
  // Optimization recommendations:
  optimizations: [
    "Implement React.lazy() for component splitting",
    "Add Suspense boundaries with skeleton loaders",
    "Prefetch critical data on route transition",
    "Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets"
  ],
  
  // Expected improvements:
  expectedImprovements: {
    initialLoadTime: "40% reduction (3s → 1.8s)",
    timeToInteractive: "60% reduction (5s → 2s)",
    perceivedPerformance: "Significant improvement with skeleton states"
